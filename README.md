## Methods

* OSBarcode
	* [scanBarcode](#scan-barcode)

* OSBarcodeScanner
	* [scan](#scan)

### Scan Barcode

```js
cordova.plugins.OSBarcode.scanBarcode(options, successCallback, errorCallback);
```

An action that triggers the barcode reader. If successful, it returns the text associated with the scanned barcode as a String. In case of an error, it returns the associated error code and message (TODO: link to the table).

The action is composed of the following parameters:

- **options**: A structure containing some configurations to apply to the barcode reader. It's composed of the following properties:
	- **scanInstructions**: A text containing the scanning instructions.
	- **cameraDirection**: An integer that indicates if the back (1) or front (2) camera will be used when triggering a new scan action.
	- **scanOrientation**: An integer that indicates which orientation will the scanner assume: Portrait (1), Landscape (2) or Adaptive (3). "Adaptive" uses the device's current orientation.
	- **scanButton**: A boolean that will display a scan button on the barcode reader. With the button, scanning will only be triggered when pressing the button instead of automatically when framing the barcode. A second click on the button disables scannning.
	- **scanText**: A text to be displayed on the scan button. It will only be shown if **scanButton** is set to true.
	- **androidScanningLibrary**: A text equivalent to the **OSBarcodeConstants.AndroidScanningLibrary** structure. It indicates which library will be used to perform the scan: MLKit or ZXing. As the name indicates, it's only applicable to "Android".
	- **scanInterval**: This is an integer value that represents the amount of delay (in milliseconds) we want to add to the ML Kit image processing to optimize the memory consumption during scanning on Android. This adjustment is only for ML Kit and will not affect ZXing.
- **successCallback**: A structure indicating that the action was successful. It returns a **ScanResult**: a text containing the value associated with the scanned barcode.
- **errorCallback**: A structure indicating that the action was not successful. It returns an "error" structure, composed of:
	- **code**: A text containing the error code.
	- **message**: A text containing the error message.

### Scan

```js
cordova.plugins.OSBarcodeScanner.scan(options, successCallback, errorCallback);
```

Being the older way to trigger the barcode reader, this was kept to keep retro compatibility. This action calls the [Scan Barcode](#scan-barcode) action, with the possible outputs being the same.

The action is composed of the following parameters:

- **options**: A structure containing some configurations to apply to the barcode reader. It's composed of the following properties:
	- **scanInstructions**: A text containing the scanning instructions.
	- **cameraDirection**: An integer that indicates if the back (1) or front (2) camera will be used when triggering a new scan action.
	- **scanOrientation**: An integer that indicates which orientation will the scanner assume: Portrait (1), Landscape (2) or Adaptive (3). "Adaptive" uses the device's current orientation.
	- **scanButton**: A boolean that will display a scan button on the barcode reader. With the button, scanning will only be triggered when pressing the button instead of automatically when framing the barcode. A second click on the button disables scannning.
	- **scanText**: A text to be displayed on the scan button. It will only be shown if **scanButton** is set to true.
- **successCallback**: A structure indicating that the action was successful. It returns a **ScanResult**: a text containing the value associated with the scanned barcode.
- **errorCallback**: A structure indicating that the action was not successful. It returns an "error" structure, composed of:
	- **code**: A text containing the error code.
	- **message**: A text containing the error message.
